git init: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
git add [file]: Adds a file or changes in a file to the staging area.
git commit -m "[commit message]": Commits changes in the staging area to the local repository.
git remote add origin [URL]: Adds a new remote repository.
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
git clone URL
Run the following command to see the existing remote repositories:
git remote -v
If the origin remote points to a different URL and you want to change it to the one you mentioned, you can use:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Mahesh-100/UPI-Payment-Application-Micronaut.git
If you'd prefer to start fresh, you can first remove the existing origin remote and then add the new one:
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/Mahesh-100/UPI-Payment-Application-Micronaut.git
